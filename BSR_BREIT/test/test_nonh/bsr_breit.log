 It is new calculations 


 c-fail (cfg.inp) contains: 

 number of atomic states   =     5
 number of configurations  =     5
 number of ang. symmetries =     5

 Need of additional calculations --> yes 
 ic =       1       5       1   d( 8)
 ic =       2       5       1   d( 8)
 ic =       3       5       1   d( 8)
 ic =       4       5       1   d( 8)
 ic =       5       5       1   d( 8)

 Results for new angular symmetry calculations:

 number of overlap determinants =         1       1.0
 number of overlap factors      =         3       1.0
 total number of coeff.s        =        25
