# DBSR - Dirac-based fully-relativistic B-spline atomic R-matrix codes

DBSR is a general program to calculate atomic continuum processes using the B-spline R-matrix method, including electron-atom and electron-ion scattering, and radiative processes such as bound-bound transitions, photoionization and polarizabilities. The calculations are performed in jj-coupling scheme using the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian.
