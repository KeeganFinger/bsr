# BSR: B-spline atomic R-matrix codes

BSR is a general program to calculate atomic continuum processes using the B-spline R-matrix method, 
including electron-atom and electron-ion scattering, and radiative processes such as bound-bound transitions, 
photoionization and polarizabilities. The calculations can be performed in LS-coupling or 
in an intermediate-coupling scheme by including terms of the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian.
