# DBSR - Dirac-based fully-relativistic B-spline atomic R-matrix codes

DBSR is a general program to calculate atomic continuum processes using the B-spline R-matrix method, including electron-atom and electron-ion scattering, and radiative processes such as bound-bound transitions, photoionization and polarizabilities. The calculations are performed in jj-coupling scheme using the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian.

# Installation

put DEF_03 (see Libraries_03) in your home directory, make corrections in the file regarding your compiler,
then compile the libraries first, then all programs in raw, using the Makefiles for each program
