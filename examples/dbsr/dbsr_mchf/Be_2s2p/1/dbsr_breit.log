==============================================================

Max. multipole index =  9

Tollerance for coefficients =    1.E-07

Breit coefficients are not included

It is a new calculation 

Breit contribution is not included 

number of atomic states   =     4
number of configurations  =     4
number of ang. symmetries =     4

Need of additional calculations --> yes

Results for new angular symmetry calculations:

number of overlap determinants =         2         2
number of overlap factors      =         3         2
total number of coeff.s        =        21
