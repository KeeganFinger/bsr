==============================================================

Max. multipole index =  9

Tollerance for coefficients =    1.E-07

Breit coefficients are not included

It is a continued calculation 

Breit contribution is not included 

number of atomic states   =     2
number of configurations  =     2
number of ang. symmetries =     2

Need of additional calculations --> no
